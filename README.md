# Welcome to the Rules as Code Handbook
## What is 'Rules as Code'?
Rules as Code is not a specific technology. Rather, it is an approach to creating and delivering better, machine consumable rulesets, with the objective of enabling the automated or semi-automated application of rules in a way that provides:

- better services that help users understand and apply laws, more easily and effectively
- more transparency, traceability and auditability in how rules are applied.

A central part of Rules as Code is the process of drafting and publishing rules in legislation, regulation, and policy in both human and machine-consumable languages (code) so they can be read and used by computers. However, the Rules as Code approach leverages existing technologies such as programming languages, rules parsing platforms and software, APIs (applied programming interfaces), expert business systems, and web design.

Ideally, a Rules as Code approach encompasses the simultaneous co-drafting of the human-readable and machine-readable versions of the ruleset, to enable the alignment of the intent of policy drafters and the logical constraints of coding. These two versions can then be published together.

However, given that most current laws and other rules are only published in human languages, there will necessarily be many Rules as Code projects that begin with a translation process, rather than a co-drafting approach.

## Who is this for?
This handbook focuses on the needs and roles of governments and the public sector in adopting Rules as Code.

However, if you're in the private sector and looking to code rules for use by business systems, you may still find some useful advice here.

## So what is this thing?
This handbook is a collaborative effort by Rules as Code teams around the world to centralise our knowledge, and make it easier for others to test and adopt Rules as Code solutions.

This is an emerging discipline, and it's evolving rapidly. A paper textbook would be out of date before it was printed. That's why we've gone with a wiki - a living document that can be updated as we learn how to do Rules as Code better and more efficiently.
